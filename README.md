## pic*i*mo

pic*i*mo is a sprite engine for javascript running in a modern browser. it is built from scratch and exclusively utilizes webgl as rendering technology.

it is written in pure ES5 javascript (no transpilers are used).

it is, however, under active development and building an awesome sprite engine together with an incredible easy api is difficult to get correct. if you are comfortable with bleeding-edge software please try picimo and share your feedback with me.

have fun!
