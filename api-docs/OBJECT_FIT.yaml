            ![The Object Fit Property](/assets/images/doc/displaySize.png)

            The object fit describes how an object size is computed in relation to its container area.

            - **contain** will always show the whole object but may not fill up the whole area.
            - **cover** will always fill the whole area, but the object may be cropped.

            Both strategies will preserve the object size ratio.

        values:
            -
                name: contain
            -
                name: cover
