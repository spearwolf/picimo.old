# NEW: I started working on picimo's successor, version 2. Itâ€™s almost a full rewrite. See the new project page [https://github.com/spearwolf/picimo](https://github.com/spearwolf/picimo)

THIS REPOSITORY IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED.


---

_picimo_ is a __sprite__ engine for __javascript__ running in a modern __browser__. it is built from scratch and exclusively utilizes __webgl__ as rendering technology.

it is written in <del>pure ES5 javascript (no transpilers are used)</del> ES2016 using the [babel](https://babeljs.io/) transpiler.

it is, however, under active development and building a *fantastic* sprite engine together with an incredible *easy-and-fun-to-use* api is difficult to get correct. if you are comfortable with bleeding-edge software please try picimo and share your feedback.

*have fun!* ;-)

## Setup local dev environment


### Prerequisites

- node **5.x** (5.11 or higher)


### Start local dev server

```sh
$ npm start
```

This will start a local http server, serves the application at
[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/), watches for changes in and *rebuilds* all
if changes are detected.

The *api docs* can be found here: [http://localhost:8080/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/api-docs)

The *source docs* can be found here: [http://localhost:8080/esdoc](http://localhost:8080/esdoc)
