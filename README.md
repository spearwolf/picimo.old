## picimo

picimo is a __sprite__ engine for __javascript__ running in a modern __browser__. it is built from scratch and exclusively utilizes __webgl__ as rendering technology.

it is written in <del>pure ES5 javascript (no transpilers are used)</del> ES2015 using the fantastic [babel](https://babeljs.io/) transpiler.

it is, however, under active development and building a *fantastic* sprite engine together with an incredible *easy-and-fun-to-use* api is difficult to get correct. if you are comfortable with bleeding-edge software please try picimo and share your feedback.

*have fun!* ;-)
