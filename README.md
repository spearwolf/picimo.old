## pic*i*mo

pic*i*mo is a __sprite__ engine for __javascript__ running in a modern __browser__. it is built from scratch and exclusively utilizes __webgl__ as rendering technology.

it is written in pure ES5 javascript (no transpilers are used).

it is, however, under active development and building a *fantastic* sprite engine together with an incredible *easy-and-fun-to-use* api is difficult to get correct. if you are comfortable with bleeding-edge software please try picimo and share your feedback with me.

*have fun!* ðŸ˜‰
